# Convolution-Neural-Network-DogsVsCats_Classification
It is one of my first trials on developing convolutional neural network for identifying dogs and cats from image. This is a part of kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats

I had idea about the way convolution neural network worked and wanted to try for myself how to do it. I was trying to develop a model on my computer, due to memory and processing limitations it took around 30 minutes just for one epoch to complete. So the first thing I learned was memory and compute power.

Google Collab ran 10 epochs in about 57 minutes.

Most of the challenges I had were related to understanding the way to implement code one of which was related to unzipping the files. and I learned that the process I used is normally feasible only for some cases. I could not use the same process when there was a folder in zip file which contained another folder within and then the image or, data I wanted to work with. But it served my purpose here.

I am grateful for all the people who have posted ways to solve problems on github and stackoverflow, it would not have been possible without them.
