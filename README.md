# Convolution-Neural-Network-DogsVsCats_Classification
It is one of my first trials on developing convolutional neural network for identifying dogs and cats from image

I was trying to develop a model on my computer, due to memory and processing limitations it took around 30 minutes just for one epoch to complete.

Google Collab ran 10 epochs in about 57 minutes.

I had some challenges relating to unzipping the files. and I learned that the process I used is normally feasible only for some cases. I could not use the same process when there was a folder in zip file which contained another folder within and then the image or, data I wanted to work with. But it worked for the work I did here.
